## [MALJAN.AI] is a web application designed to assist farmers with their livestock and farm management. It provides an AI-powered chat assistant, Maljan.AI, which helps users with various tasks related to farming, such as providing advice on livestock care, suggesting crop management strategies, and answering farming-related questions.

Technical Considerations
Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes the Chat UI Kit React library for the chat interface.

Backend: The backend is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model, which provides the conversational AI capabilities for the chat assistant.

API Integration: The application integrates with the Google Cloud Vision API to analyze images uploaded by users for farm-related tasks, such as identifying plant diseases or livestock health issues.

Styling: The app's styling is done using CSS for layout and design, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user experience.
